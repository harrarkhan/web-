<h2 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p><ul><li>Potatoes</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon of black pepper powder
    </li>
<li>½ teaspoon of Kashmiri red chili powder or sweet paprika</li>
<li>½ teaspoon of roasted cumin powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon of dry mango powder (amchur powder) </li>
<li>½ teaspoon of chaat masala powder</li>
<li>black salt or pink salt or regular white salt to taste</li></ul></p>
    <h2 id="make">how to make aloo chat</h2>
    <p><ol><li> Rinse 3 medium sized potatoes (250 grams) in fresh water and then peel them. Chop the potatoes in small bite sized cubes.</li>
    <li> Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan or kadai on a medium heat. Add the potato cubes for frying. Use any neutral flavored with a high smoke point for frying.</li>
<il> Mix with the oil and begin to fry them. Remember to fry at medium heat.

    Warm or a cooler temperature of the oil will make the potatoes soggy with oil. A very hot oil will brown the outer crust of the potato cubes quickly but they will be undercooked from the center.</il>
<li>When one side becomes golden, turn the potatoes over and fry them on the other side. Keep on turning the potatoes at intervals using a slotted spoon until they are fried evenly.</li>
<li>Fry until the potatoes are crispy and golden. Make sure the potato cubes are not raw or half-cooked on the inside.</li>
<li>Once the potatoes are tender, crisp and golden then remove them with a slotted spoon draining as much oil in the pan as possible.</li>
<li>Place fried potato cubes on kitchen paper towels to absorb extra oil. Then, fry the second batch of potatoes if you have used a small or medium-sized wok or pan.</li>
<li> When the potatoes are still hot take all of them in a mixing bowl.</br> Then add the following ground spice powders:</br>¼ teaspoon of black pepper powder </br>½ teaspoon of Kashmiri red chili powder or sweet paprika</br>½ teaspoon of roasted cumin powder</br>½ teaspoon of dry mango powder (amchur powder) </br>½ teaspoon of chaat masala powder</br>black salt or pink salt or regular white salt to taste</li>
<li>Next, add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped mint leaves and 2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves (cilantro).</li>
<li>Then add 1 tablespoon of sweet tamarind chutney. Add less or more to suit your taste. At this step you can add coriander chutney or green chutney if you want.

</li>
<li>Toss and mix everything very well. The chutney, spice powders and lemon juice should coat the fried potatoes evenly. Taste the potatoes and adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
</ol></p>

<P>You can also air-fry the potatoes instead of frying and follow the rest of the recipe. I have tried this air-frying method and the potatoes tasted just as delicious and they were a bit lighter compared to fried aloo chat.</br>Simply coat the potato cubes with 1 to 2 tablespoons oil. Preheat your air-fryer for 5 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius. Then air-fry the potato cubes at a moderately hot temperature of 180 degrees Celsius/356 Fahrenheit until crispy and golden.</br>Do remove the air-fryer basket a couple of times while air-frying. Gently shake or toss the basket or turn over the potato cubes with a spoon, spatula or fork. Place the basket with the potatoes back into the air-fryer and continue to air-fry.</P>
